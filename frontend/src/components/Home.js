                        <p> Hey! I'm Jade and I like to build stuff with code.  I went to
                            Hackbright Academy in March 2018, a software engineering program
                            for women in San Francisco.  Here, I learned Python, Javascript,
                            React, SQL, Flask, Jquery, HTML, CSS and even a little D3. Now I'm an
                            Intern at <a className='quid' href='https://quid.com/'>Quid</a>, learning technologies like Docker, Elastic Search, Apache Spark,
                            Apache Kafka and oh so much more.</p>
                            <br/>
                        <p> Before I entered the wonderful world of tech, I built thriving communities who shared
                            a passion for inspiring a generation of self-directed learners. These small but mighty
                            learners built games with code, constructed robotic obstacle courses and produced a number
                            of short films. After seeing our technology move their motivation, I knew I wanted I
                            wanted to take the leap into software engineering.  So, I guess you can say I was inspired
                            by a community of over 1,000 kids to learn how to code. </p>
                            <br/>
                        <p> In my past life, I traveled & represented the U.S. competing the art of Muay Thai [mwei Ëˆtai].
                           Also known as the science of 8 limbs, it's a martial art with elbows, knees, kicks, and punches.
                           You can see some of my accomplishments from this part of my life in the <Link className='project-intro' smooth to="/#muaythai">Muay Thai section</Link> of this
                           site... Who knows, maybe I'll step back in that ring sometime soon. </p>
